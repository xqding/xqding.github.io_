Understanding chromosome strucures and dynamics using both data-driven statistical modeling and physics-based modeling; Understanding intrinsically disordered proteins. Connecting deep generative models with non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  During my PhD study, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Charles L. Brooks III. The focuses of my PhD research include developing theorectical/computational methods for protein-ligand docking and free energy calculation and applying deep generative models to study protein evolution, fitness landscape and stablity.\nI love collaborating with both theoretical and experimental researchers, so feel free to contact me if you have a project for which my expertise might be helpful.\n","date":1622916965,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1622916965,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hello!
